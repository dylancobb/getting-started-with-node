# Getting started with Node.js

This repo is just to keep track as I work through unit 1 of [Get Programming With Node.js](https://amzn.eu/d/1SdEKQ3) by Jonathan Wexler, which covers setting up a basic HTTP server in Node.js and handling routing (without the use of Express.js, which is introduced in the next unit).

### Lesson 3

- Covered npm basics and exporting / requiring modules in Node.

### Lesson 4

- Covered the setup of a basic HTTP server that simply responds to all requests with HTML (at this stage, from directly inside the same file).

### Lesson 5

- Explored how to set up basic routing to serve different HTML for different url requests.
